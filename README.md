# Who is behind this?
Hey, I'm going by the pseudonym 'Gyshni,' a back-end developer and cryptocurrency enthusiast. As I'm writing this, I'm in the process of building an online cryptocurrency called "Primekeno" with the main objective of maintaining fairness, transparency, and security for every user gambling. In my point of view, transparency is undoubtedly one of the most important features, if not the most important, in cryptocurrency casinos, so that's why I created this repository.
